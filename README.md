# Leetcode

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Dhiraj072/leetcode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Dhiraj072/leetcode)

Online [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) judge is too slow for me. This is my gradle project to compile and test my solutions locally. And then make a submission.


## Built With

* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Build tool
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/) - Testing Framework
* [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) - Helps me write tests easily, sometimes
